## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

I learned a lot about using TailwindCSS.

### Continued development

Will add more functionality in the future.

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This is an amazing CSS framework which helped me composed the design directly in my markup. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
